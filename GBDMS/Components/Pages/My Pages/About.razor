            Disaster resilience is a contemporary concept applied globally to mitigate the effects of natural hazards. A disaster is the result of the interaction between natural hazards and the human ecosystem. It is widely recognized that natural hazards alone do not cause significant loss or damage; rather, it is poor human settlements and inadequate preparedness that transform hazards into full-fledged disasters. Resilience, as a modern practice in disaster management, encourages all levels of society to consider disaster risk reduction at the planning stage of every human development activity. To build true resilience against natural disasters, it is crucial to understand the nature and intensity of hazards in conjunction with human populations and ecosystems. Hazard and risk information are fundamental for effective disaster risk reduction and management.

        <p class="text-justify">
            The Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management System (GBDMS), developed with the technical support of relevant organizations and financial assistance from the government, aims to enhance disaster preparedness and response in the region. GBDMS is designed to provide a robust framework for disaster risk reduction, ensuring the safety and resilience of communities across Gilgit-Baltistan. This system serves as an integrated platform to facilitate data collection, monitoring, and decision-making during disaster events.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            The GBDMS incorporates several key modules to aid in comprehensive disaster management, including risk assessment, early warning systems, resource management, and real-time coordination. Modules such as GIS for hazard mapping, weather forecasts, rapid damage assessments, and emergency response coordination are central to the system's functionality. These modules ensure that relevant stakeholders have access to accurate and timely information during each phase of disaster management, from preparedness to recovery.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            The GBDMS is expected to play a critical role in future disaster management planning at the district and community levels across Gilgit-Baltistan. Local disaster management authorities (DDMAs) are encouraged to integrate the GBDMS into their operations, ensuring that disaster risk reduction interventions are aligned with the risk profiles of each district and sub-district (UC).
